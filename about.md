Just another wannabe Software Engineer. I like building stuffs for iOS. I have not travelled a lot but I like travelling and exploring new places. Maybe some day, when the time is right, I will serve myself an expedition to the jungle. Till then, jekyll --serve my github page. Dont ask me why I chose Jekyll over Wordpress.

### More Information
I am a very secretive person. Opening up has caused me a lot of trouble lately. So decided to just chill and blog the fuck out. BTW, all the code and samples in my blogs are under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), if not, I will mention it explicitly.

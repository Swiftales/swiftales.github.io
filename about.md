Just another wannabe Software Engineer. I like building stuffs for iOS. I have not travelled a lot but I like travelling and exploring new places. Maybe some day, when the time is right, I will serve myself an expedition to the jungle. I like wildlife. Till then, jekyll --serve my github page. I chose Jekyll over Wordpress because...damn it feels good to be a Gangsta!. I dont really know.


### More Information
I am a very secretive person. Opening up often leads to predicament. So decided to just chill and blog the fuck out. BTW, all the code and samples in my blogs are under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), if not, it will be mentioned explicitly.

Just another Software Engineer. I like building stuffs for iOS. I have not travelled a lot but I like travelling and exploring new places. Maybe some day, when the time is right, I will serve myself an expedition to the jungle. I like wildlife. Till then, jekyll --serve my page. I chose Jekyll over Wordpress because...damn it feels good to be a Gangsta!. I dont really know.

BTW, all the code and samples in my blogs are under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net), if not, I will mention it explicitly.
